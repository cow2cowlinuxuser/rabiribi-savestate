/* Giving the game a heap of its own.
 *
 * Every ownership heuristic in savestate.c exists for one reason: Rabi-Ribi
 * links ucrtbase, and ucrtbase does not create a heap. It calls GetProcessHeap
 * and allocates out of the same arena ntdll, GDI and combase are using. So the
 * game's state and Windows' state are interleaved block by block in one heap,
 * and every restore has to guess which is which. BLKOWNER, HELDVETO, VTABVETO,
 * the reachability closure and the recycled-block hazard are all consequences
 * of that single fact.
 *
 * DoDonPachi Resurrection is the control group, and it says what the other side
 * looks like. It links MSVCR100, which calls HeapCreate, so the game's runtime
 * heap has no other tenant. Its restore reported 208 regions, none by block, and
 * captured 1076 MB of 1089 - 98.8% of the process, with no ownership vote taken
 * anywhere. Rabi-Ribi's captures 59% and negotiates for the rest.
 *
 * We cannot change which runtime the game links. We can change where its
 * allocations land: create a heap, and redirect the executable's imports of
 * malloc and friends into it. What the game allocates from then on has no other
 * tenant, exactly as if it had linked MSVCR100.
 *
 * Three things make this safe rather than merely appealing.
 *
 * The redirect goes in after the process has started, so everything allocated
 * before it still lives on the process heap and will be freed through a pointer
 * we did not issue. free therefore dispatches: ours goes to our heap, everything
 * else goes to the runtime's own free, unchanged. The mixed period is correct by
 * construction rather than by timing.
 *
 * Ownership is not decided by address alone. A range table says which regions
 * our heap has been seen to occupy, and every block we issue carries an eight
 * byte header whose magic is keyed to the pointer it precedes. The range check
 * comes first because it cannot fault; the header is only read once the range
 * says the memory was ours, and it is what actually decides. A region that our
 * heap later hands back to the operating system can therefore never be mistaken
 * for ours if somebody else is given the same address.
 *
 * Allocations at or above GH_BIG stay with the runtime. A private heap satisfies
 * those with a dedicated VirtualAlloc that is released on free, which is the one
 * way a range in our table goes stale. They are also rare and long-lived, which
 * is to say they are not the state that fails to travel.
 *
 * Off unless D3D9SW_GAMEHEAP=1. This moves where the game's memory lives, and
 * nothing else in the engine has ever done that. */

 *
 * D3D9SW_GHTRACE=N records the first N allocator operations - what kind, how

 * beside the log.
 *
 * The reason to have it is an observation that is currently resting on two data
 * points. The player entity has been found at heap base + 0x7F4B8 in two
 * separate sessions whose heap bases differed (0DFB0000 and 0DC70000), which
 * says the heap's internal placement is a function of the allocation sequence
 * and nothing else - the base moves, the contents do not. If that holds over
 * tens of thousands of operations rather than one lucky pointer, then a
 * snapshot is relocatable and an address in it can be derived from a single
 * anchor. If it does not hold, everything built on it falls over, and it is far
 * cheaper to find that out from a diff of two traces than from a restore that
 * faults.
 *
 * Two runs, diff the offset column. Identical means deterministic.
 *
 * Constraints this sits under: it runs inside the game's malloc, on every call,
 * so it must not allocate, must not lock, and must not touch a file. A slot is
 * claimed with one interlocked increment into a buffer reserved up front, and
 * the whole thing is written out later from the census, which already runs on a
 * frame boundary. A lock here would change the timing of the very thing being
 * measured.

 * because it is a code offset in an executable that does not change between
 * launches; the count is stable for as long as the game takes the same path,
 * which is the property actually under test.
 *

 * paths allocating two different things would otherwise interleave its counts
 * and produce an ordinal that means nothing in either.
 *
 * The tags live beside the heap in a table keyed by address, NOT in GhHead.
 * Widening that header would push every block along and destroy the offset
 * agreement these tags exist to measure - the measurement would change the
 * thing being measured.
 *

 * call, so it must not allocate, must not lock and must not touch a file. Both
 * tables are reserved up front and reached with interlocked operations only.

 * with the process heap's handle and an address the process heap never issued,
 * which is how a heap gets corrupted rather than how one gets freed.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. A restore rewinds our heap wholesale, so a block the
 * game allocated after the save has, the moment the copy lands, a header from
 * whatever older thing occupied those bytes. The game frees it a few hundred
 * frames later - tearing down audio it thinks is still playing - the magic does
 * not match, and the block goes out through the runtime to a heap that never
 * owned it. The fault lands inside ntdll's free path reading an uncommitted page
 * in OUR arena, which reads as a Windows bug until you know where the pointer
 * came from.
 *
 * g_stale has been counting exactly this case since the day it was written, and
 * the report has been calling it "a hole worth reading about". It was.

/* ---- big blocks, import mode (D3D9SW_GAMEHEAP=2) ---------------------------
 *
 * A heap at a caller-chosen base is not growable, and a heap that cannot grow
 * refuses any block above about 512 KB - measured: 300 KB is served from inside
 * the region, 8 MB fails outright. PhysX's scene pools are bigger than that, and
 * sending them back to the runtime puts them on the process heap, which the
 * import mode leaves in the present. The bodies would rewind and the solver's
 * buffers they point into would not.
 *
 * So big blocks get a region of their own with an allocator simple enough that
 * all of its state - free list, high-water mark, lock - lives in the region's
 * first page. Restoring the region restores the allocator with it, which is the
 * property the process heap lacked. First fit over an address-ordered free list,
 * coalesced on free; there are hundreds of these blocks, not millions. Freed
 * memory stays committed, so the region's shape never changes under a save.
 *
 * The regions are chunks, added as the ones before fill and never released, so
 * no size has to be guessed up front and no range in the ownership table ever
 * goes stale. A chunk added after a save is simply not in that snapshot; with
 * reclaim off (the default) the restore leaves it alone, and whatever it holds
 * is unreachable from the rewound game - a leak, not a tear. A block bigger
 * than a chunk gets a chunk of its own size. */

/* Where the allocator actually is.
 *
 * The premise above is wrong in one detail that turns out to decide the method.
 * Rabi-Ribi does not link ucrtbase; it links the runtime statically. Its import
 * list is KERNEL32, USER32, GDI32, SHELL32 and STEAM_API and nothing else, so
 * the ucrtbase in the process belongs to Windows and the game never calls it.
 * That is why redirecting imports found nothing to redirect: there is no import
 * to redirect. The conclusion the log drew - that the game's runtime heap comes
 * from ucrtbase - named the right heap for the wrong reason.
 *
 * The allocator is in the game's own .text, and Ghidra found the whole of it by
 * working back from the floor that every allocator has to reach. Five functions
 * touch the runtime's heap handle, and only five:
 *
 *   malloc   0036E6B2 -> HeapAlloc      54 callers
 *   calloc   0037EBF7 -> HeapAlloc       2 callers   (__calloc_impl)
 *   realloc  0036E744 -> HeapReAlloc    15 callers
 *   free     00369754 -> HeapFree      107 callers
 *   _msize   0037805A -> HeapSize        2 callers
 *
 * All five read the handle from one global at 0118E588, which is __acrt_heap. A
 * static UCRT sets it to GetProcessHeap(), and that single assignment is the
 * origin of every ownership heuristic in savestate.c.
 *
 * The three other free-shaped functions in the image were the reason to go
 * looking. None of them touches HeapFree; they tail-call this one. The set is
 * closed, which is the property that makes hooking it safe - a block allocated
 * through us and released through a routine we missed would go to HeapFree on a
 * heap it does not belong to.
 *
 * Nothing outside the runtime shares these. The four other Heap* callers in the
 * image ask GetProcessHeap for themselves and free what they themselves
 * allocated; they never see a pointer of ours.
 *
 * So we detour the game's private copies rather than redirecting an import.
 * That is better than the original plan, not a fallback from it: the copies
 * belong to the game alone, so the redirect cannot reach Windows even by
 * accident. Windows keeps ucrtbase; the game gets a heap with no other tenant.
 *
 * Tempting and rejected: write our heap handle into __acrt_heap and change no
 * code at all. Every allocation already live at that moment came from the
 * process heap, and the next free would hand it to HeapFree against a heap that
 * never issued it. The swap is only safe before the runtime initialises, and we
 * are loaded by LoadLibrary long after. Detours dispatch per pointer, so the
 * mixed period is correct by construction. */

 * addresses every launch. A byte snapshot of one only restores if it comes back
 * at the same base - the very property the pinned arena gives the CRT heap, and

 * Before pinning any of them we have to know the placement is worth pinning:
 * that the sequence of big reservations - which call site, in what order, at
 * what size - is the SAME up to the save point across two fresh launches. If it
 * is, a deterministic (module, call site, ordinal) key can hand each region a
 * stable slot in a reserved pool. If it is not, this log is what says so, and
 * says what to key on instead.
 *
 * This changes nothing: every call is forwarded to the real VirtualAlloc. It
 * only records, and only for reservations at or above the threshold. Off unless
 * D3D9SW_VALOG=1; D3D9SW_VALOG_KB overrides the 1 MB floor. The return address
 * is resolved to its module so a reservation made from ucrtbase or the game's

/* ------------------------------------- import mode (D3D9SW_GAMEHEAP=2)
 *
 * The same private heap for a game that links the C runtime as a DLL, which is
 * the easy case the detours above had to work around. Haydee is one: every one
 * of its modules - haydee.dll, game.dll and the three PhysX DLLs - takes malloc
 * and friends from api-ms-win-crt-heap, which is ucrtbase, which allocates from
 * the process heap. That shared heap is what the restore could neither rewind
 * (Windows keeps low-fragmentation bookkeeping for it outside its segments, and
 * the first allocation after a restore divided by a zero block count) nor hold
 * back (the game's objects would stay in the future).
 *
 * So the import slots are pointed at us, module by module, and the game's
 * allocations land in a heap nothing else uses. Selected by '2' rather than '1'
 * so a game configured for the detour build is never touched by this one, and
 * installed only from the OpenGL wrapper's attach, which is the one build that
 * runs early enough to see these modules before their own initialisation.
 *
 * What makes it safe to be partial: frees dispatch per pointer, so blocks the
 * runtime issued before the install still go back to it; and the runtime's own
 * HeapFree, HeapReAlloc and HeapSize imports are patched as a floor, so a block
 * of ours that reaches ucrtbase by any route - another module's free, a realloc
 * inside the runtime, _aligned_free - is caught there instead of being handed
 * to the process heap. */

/* ---- OpenAL objects across a restore ---------------------------------------
 * The game's audio lives in OpenAL32/wrap_oal from the system folder, which a
 * restore leaves in the present. So after one, OpenAL still has every source and
 * buffer the game made since the save (forgotten by the game, and leaking
 * voices each time), lacks the ones it deleted since (still in use by the game),
 * and its streaming queues no longer match what the game will unqueue.
 *
 * Two records of the same objects: g_al_game in our image's data, which rewinds
 * with the game and so always says what the game believes, and g_al_real, held
 * in the present, which says what OpenAL has. After a restore the first AL call
 * the game makes brings OpenAL back in line - on the game's own thread, never
 * from inside the restore, where a suspended thread may hold OpenAL's lock.
 * Deletes are held back (stopped and emptied) while any save exists, so a
 * restore has something to bring back. D3D9SW_REWIND_AL=0 turns it off. */

 * Nth question gets the Nth answer even if a tick lands on another frame. The
 * frame is kept to say when that happens.
 *
 * The real device is still asked first during a replay, so its buffer keeps
 * draining and live input picks up cleanly when the recording runs out. A call
 * that does not match the next record - another device, method, size or
 * request - ends the replay at that point rather than feeding the game answers

/* ------------------------------------------------- where the heap itself goes
 *
 * D3D9SW_GHPIN puts the private heap at an address we choose instead of one
 * Windows chooses.
 *
 * This is the change that makes a layout reproducible, and the evidence for it
 * is unusually direct. Two sessions were made to issue byte-identical
 * allocation sequences - same 2,133 operations, same order - and replayed
 * against four allocators. HeapCreate put 93% of the blocks at different
 * offsets both times. Disabling the low-fragmentation heap changed nothing,
 * which killed the obvious theory. RtlCreateHeap at a fixed base reproduced
 * every block, at every checkpoint, exactly.
 *
 * The only difference between those cases is the base, so the base is the
 * cause: HeapCreate has no address parameter, Windows picks one, and the
 * internal layout follows from it.
 *
 * Worth being clear about why an address matters when a snapshot could simply
 * record offsets. It is not the snapshot that needs the address, it is the
 * contents: the blocks are full of pointers to each other, and a pointer is
 * only meaningful against the layout it was written for. Restoring the bytes
 * faithfully into a heap that moved is how a restored pointer ends up aimed at
 * whatever now occupies that address.
 *
 * A caller-supplied base means the heap cannot grow - there is nothing after
 * the reservation it is entitled to take. That is deliberate. Peak live in this
 * heap has been measured at 0.47 MB and everything at or above 256 KB is handed
 * to the runtime anyway, so the reservation below is orders of magnitude clear;
 * and if it is ever wrong, gh_malloc already falls back to the runtime and
 * g_fellback counts it, so the failure is a report rather than a crash.
 */
/* 0x20000000, not 0x50000000: the startup probe (d3d11_sw arena_probe) measured
 * the largest contiguous free hole at each candidate base, and 0x20000000 has by
 * far the most room (~1.15 GB early vs ~0.4 GB at 0x50000000). At 128 MB either
 * base takes, but 0x50000000 could not fit a larger arena - the 512 MB attempt
 * there failed with error 487 and fell back to an OS-placed base, which is NOT
 * the same address next session and so breaks cross-session pointers. Pinning at
 * 0x20000000 keeps the fixed base for any arena size we are likely to want,
 * meaning the arena stays DETERMINISTIC across sessions and drops out of the
 * relocation problem entirely. The d3d11 texture arena is steered off this base
 * so the two do not fight for it. */

 * makes it useful - the allocator operation number at the time of the call.
 *
 * The question it answers. Two sessions from an identical save allocate
 * identically for 3,363 operations and then differ in the length of one string.
 * Something the game knows must therefore differ before that point while
 * leaving no trace in the heap until it is formatted, and a value read from the
 * calendar is the obvious candidate: it changes every run by construction, it
 * is usually stored in a fixed-size structure or a register rather than an
 * allocation, and it becomes visible exactly when somebody prints it.
 *
 * The operation number is what turns this from a list into evidence. Clock
 * calls and allocations are two streams with no common clock of their own; the
 * trace index is a counter both can be read against, so a call reported at
 * operation 3,300 is one that happened in the window where the divergence was
 * introduced, and a call at operation 7,000 is not.
 *
 * Only the calendar functions are hooked, not QueryPerformanceCounter or
 * timeGetTime. Those are read every frame and would bury the rare calls that
 * matter under thousands that do not - and a per-frame timer is a poor seed
 * anyway, being exactly what the game would use for animation.
 *

/* -------------------------------------------------- the allocation watch
 *
 * GHVORBIS names the moment a track loads; this names the block a track load
 * hands back. Set D3D9SW_GHWATCH to the size(s) of the block being chased - the
 * 0ED6BEB0-class Vorbis decoder object is ~3.6 KB - and/or D3D9SW_GHWATCHSITE to
 * a call-site RVA, and every matching allocation prints, at the instant it is
 * served: the allocator operation number it lands at (the SAME clock GHVORBIS
 * prints its landmark on, so the two line up directly), the call site as
 * rabiribi.exe+RVA, the returned address, and whether that address is in our
 * arena or on a heap we do not own.
 *
 * The point is provenance across a restore. The block that faults after a
 * restore-across-a-track-change is read through a pointer that came back wrong;
 * to fix it we first need to know which code allocates it and where in the load
 * sequence, so a second run can confirm the site is deterministic. If the watch
 * stays silent for a size known to crash, that is itself the answer: the block
 * is born on a path we never owned (foreign heap, no redirect, no tag), which is
 * exactly why a restore cannot keep it consistent.
 *
 * Sizes are matched exactly, because the trace has shown block sizes are
 * deterministic to the byte at a fixed point in the sequence. One ss_log per
 * match, capped; on a miss the only cost is the size compare, and every path
 * this sits on is already handing back a pointer - it allocates nothing. */

 * HeapCreate, so it shows up here as a [game/other] heap distinct from our arena
 * and the process default.
 *
 * Read-only; forwarded to nobody. Must run while all threads are still LIVE, so
 * HeapLock can serialise each walk normally - walking a heap whose lock a
 * suspended thread holds would hang, which is why the save calls this BEFORE it
 * freezes. Each heap is guarded and skipped on failure so one uncooperative heap
 * never sinks the census, and the walk is bounded. 32-bit process, so every size
