/* Giving the game a heap of its own.
 *
 * Every ownership heuristic in savestate.c exists for one reason: Rabi-Ribi
 * links ucrtbase, and ucrtbase does not create a heap. It calls GetProcessHeap
 * and allocates out of the same arena ntdll, GDI and combase are using. So the
 * game's state and Windows' state are interleaved block by block in one heap,
 * and every restore has to guess which is which. BLKOWNER, HELDVETO, VTABVETO,
 * the reachability closure and the recycled-block hazard are all consequences
 * of that single fact.
 *
 * DoDonPachi Resurrection is the control group, and it says what the other side
 * looks like. It links MSVCR100, which calls HeapCreate, so the game's runtime
 * heap has no other tenant. Its restore reported 208 regions, none by block, and
 * captured 1076 MB of 1089 - 98.8% of the process, with no ownership vote taken
 * anywhere. Rabi-Ribi's captures 59% and negotiates for the rest.
 *
 * We cannot change which runtime the game links. We can change where its
 * allocations land: create a heap, and redirect the executable's imports of
 * malloc and friends into it. What the game allocates from then on has no other
 * tenant, exactly as if it had linked MSVCR100.
 *
 * Three things make this safe rather than merely appealing.
 *
 * The redirect goes in after the process has started, so everything allocated
 * before it still lives on the process heap and will be freed through a pointer
 * we did not issue. free therefore dispatches: ours goes to our heap, everything
 * else goes to the runtime's own free, unchanged. The mixed period is correct by
 * construction rather than by timing.
 *
 * Ownership is not decided by address alone. A range table says which regions
 * our heap has been seen to occupy, and every block we issue carries an eight
 * byte header whose magic is keyed to the pointer it precedes. The range check
 * comes first because it cannot fault; the header is only read once the range
 * says the memory was ours, and it is what actually decides. A region that our
 * heap later hands back to the operating system can therefore never be mistaken
 * for ours if somebody else is given the same address.
 *
 * Allocations at or above GH_BIG stay with the runtime. A private heap satisfies
 * those with a dedicated VirtualAlloc that is released on free, which is the one
 * way a range in our table goes stale. They are also rare and long-lived, which
 * is to say they are not the state that fails to travel.
 *
 * Off unless D3D9SW_GAMEHEAP=1. This moves where the game's memory lives, and
 * nothing else in the engine has ever done that. */

 *
 * The reason to have it is an observation that is currently resting on two data
 * points. The player entity has been found at heap base + 0x7F4B8 in two
 * separate sessions whose heap bases differed (0DFB0000 and 0DC70000), which
 * says the heap's internal placement is a function of the allocation sequence
 * and nothing else - the base moves, the contents do not. If that holds over
 * tens of thousands of operations rather than one lucky pointer, then a
 * snapshot is relocatable and an address in it can be derived from a single
 * anchor. If it does not hold, everything built on it falls over, and it is far
 * cheaper to find that out from a diff of two traces than from a restore that
 * faults.
 *
 * Two runs, diff the offset column. Identical means deterministic.
 *
 * Constraints this sits under: it runs inside the game's malloc, on every call,
 * so it must not allocate, must not lock, and must not touch a file. A slot is
 * claimed with one interlocked increment into a buffer reserved up front, and
 * the whole thing is written out later from the census, which already runs on a
 * frame boundary. A lock here would change the timing of the very thing being
 * measured.

 * Widening that header would push every block along and destroy the offset
 * agreement these tags exist to measure - the measurement would change the

/* Where the allocator actually is.
 *
 * The premise above is wrong in one detail that turns out to decide the method.
 * Rabi-Ribi does not link ucrtbase; it links the runtime statically. Its import
 * list is KERNEL32, USER32, GDI32, SHELL32 and STEAM_API and nothing else, so
 * the ucrtbase in the process belongs to Windows and the game never calls it.
 * That is why redirecting imports found nothing to redirect: there is no import
 * to redirect. The conclusion the log drew - that the game's runtime heap comes
 * from ucrtbase - named the right heap for the wrong reason.
 *
 * The allocator is in the game's own .text, and Ghidra found the whole of it by
 * working back from the floor that every allocator has to reach. Five functions
 * touch the runtime's heap handle, and only five:
 *
 *   malloc   0036E6B2 -> HeapAlloc      54 callers
 *   calloc   0037EBF7 -> HeapAlloc       2 callers   (__calloc_impl)
 *   realloc  0036E744 -> HeapReAlloc    15 callers
 *   free     00369754 -> HeapFree      107 callers
 *   _msize   0037805A -> HeapSize        2 callers
 *
 * All five read the handle from one global at 0118E588, which is __acrt_heap. A
 * static UCRT sets it to GetProcessHeap(), and that single assignment is the
 * origin of every ownership heuristic in savestate.c.
 *
 * The three other free-shaped functions in the image were the reason to go
 * looking. None of them touches HeapFree; they tail-call this one. The set is
 * closed, which is the property that makes hooking it safe - a block allocated
 * through us and released through a routine we missed would go to HeapFree on a
 * heap it does not belong to.
 *
 * Nothing outside the runtime shares these. The four other Heap* callers in the
 * image ask GetProcessHeap for themselves and free what they themselves
 * allocated; they never see a pointer of ours.
 *
 * So we detour the game's private copies rather than redirecting an import.
 * That is better than the original plan, not a fallback from it: the copies
 * belong to the game alone, so the redirect cannot reach Windows even by
 * accident. Windows keeps ucrtbase; the game gets a heap with no other tenant.
 *
 * Tempting and rejected: write our heap handle into __acrt_heap and change no
 * code at all. Every allocation already live at that moment came from the
 * process heap, and the next free would hand it to HeapFree against a heap that
 * never issued it. The swap is only safe before the runtime initialises, and we
 * are loaded by LoadLibrary long after. Detours dispatch per pointer, so the
 * mixed period is correct by construction. */

/* ---- dedicated VirtualAlloc for big floor blocks ---------------------------
 *
 * gh_floor_arena sends anything >= GH_BIG here instead of into the shared arena.
 * Each big block is its own VirtualAlloc reservation, so it never fragments the
 * fixed arena and never needs it grown - the arena then only ever holds small
 * blocks. The block is committed private memory, so a save captures it and it
 * rewinds with the game like any owned block; on free it is released with
 * VirtualFree, which - unlike HeapFree - reads no heap metadata and so cannot
 * fault on a block whose contents a restore rewound. Identified at free time by
 * a small present-tense registry rather than by the arena's in_range table, so
 * releasing one never leaves a stale range that could launder a later address
 * into ours. Blocks the game orphans across a restore leak their reservation -
 * a bounded, later-reclaimable cost, not a crash. */

/* ------------------------------------------------- where the heap itself goes
 *
 * D3D9SW_GHPIN puts the private heap at an address we choose instead of one
 * Windows chooses.
 *
 * This is the change that makes a layout reproducible, and the evidence for it
 * is unusually direct. Two sessions were made to issue byte-identical
 * allocation sequences - same 2,133 operations, same order - and replayed
 * against four allocators. HeapCreate put 93% of the blocks at different
 * offsets both times. Disabling the low-fragmentation heap changed nothing,
 * which killed the obvious theory. RtlCreateHeap at a fixed base reproduced
 * every block, at every checkpoint, exactly.
 *
 * The only difference between those cases is the base, so the base is the
 * cause: HeapCreate has no address parameter, Windows picks one, and the
 * internal layout follows from it.
 *
 * Worth being clear about why an address matters when a snapshot could simply
 * record offsets. It is not the snapshot that needs the address, it is the
 * contents: the blocks are full of pointers to each other, and a pointer is
 * only meaningful against the layout it was written for. Restoring the bytes
 * faithfully into a heap that moved is how a restored pointer ends up aimed at
 * whatever now occupies that address.
 *
 * A caller-supplied base means the heap cannot grow - there is nothing after
 * the reservation it is entitled to take. That is deliberate. Peak live in this
 * heap has been measured at 0.47 MB and everything at or above 256 KB is handed
 * to the runtime anyway, so the reservation below is orders of magnitude clear;
 * and if it is ever wrong, gh_malloc already falls back to the runtime and
 * g_fellback counts it, so the failure is a report rather than a crash.

 *
 * The question it answers. Two sessions from an identical save allocate
 * identically for 3,363 operations and then differ in the length of one string.
 * Something the game knows must therefore differ before that point while
 * leaving no trace in the heap until it is formatted, and a value read from the
 * calendar is the obvious candidate: it changes every run by construction, it
 * is usually stored in a fixed-size structure or a register rather than an
 * allocation, and it becomes visible exactly when somebody prints it.
 *
 * The operation number is what turns this from a list into evidence. Clock
 * calls and allocations are two streams with no common clock of their own; the
 * trace index is a counter both can be read against, so a call reported at
 * operation 3,300 is one that happened in the window where the divergence was
 * introduced, and a call at operation 7,000 is not.
 *
 * Only the calendar functions are hooked, not QueryPerformanceCounter or
 * timeGetTime. Those are read every frame and would bury the rare calls that
 * matter under thousands that do not - and a per-frame timer is a poor seed
 * anyway, being exactly what the game would use for animation.
