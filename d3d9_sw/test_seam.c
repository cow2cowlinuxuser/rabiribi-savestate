/* TEST 3 - the one that catches a convention mismatch.
 *
 * Every test above is written in the rasterizer's own coordinate convention, so
 * they are self-consistent and therefore blind to that convention being wrong.
 * This one is not. It reproduces the game's composite quad exactly as the D3D9
 * SDK instructs titles to build it in "Directly Mapping Texels to Pixels" -
 * vertices running -0.5 .. W-0.5 across the full texture - and then applies the
 * wrapper's screen-space shift as a parameter.
 *
 * The oracle needs no reference image and no golden data. If a 1:1 blit is
 * correctly aligned then every pixel centre lands on a texel centre, the
 * bilinear weights collapse to exactly 1 and 0, and so BILINEAR MUST EQUAL
 * POINT and both must equal the source. Get the half pixel wrong and bilinear
 * becomes a 2x2 average while point becomes a coin flip between two texels.
 * That is the failure the game has been showing us. */
