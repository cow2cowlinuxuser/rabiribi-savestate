 * Two things recommend it. The probe above shows one contiguous ~1.15 GB hole
 * from 20000000 at DLL attach, and a region reserved at a chosen base comes
 * back at the same address in a new process, which is the precondition for a
 * save file that outlives the run. Second, and useful immediately: payloads
 * currently land wherever VirtualAlloc puts them, which is what drove the
 * largest free block down to a few megabytes while hundreds of megabytes were
 * still nominally free. Confining them to one reservation cannot fragment
 * anything outside it, and freeing decommits the pages so the memory returns to
 * the OS while the address space stays ours.
 *
 * Extents live in their own allocation rather than inline headers, so the arena
 * holds nothing but payload bytes and a freed block can be decommitted whole.
 * Off by default: it changes where every large allocation in the process lives. */

 * much to trust what comes out the other side. That guard was a REPAIR: we knew

 * keeps the process running without making it right, and the game continues on

 *
 * Reads only, deliberately. A healed read fabricates a zero the game then acts
 * on; a healed write would discard data the game believed it had stored, and
 * this game writes a save file. Losing a session to a crash is recoverable,
 * quietly corrupting a save is not.
 *
 * Two mechanisms, because the faults come in two shapes:
 *
 *   A page that is reserved or free, read just past something committed - the
 *   overrun signature. Commit it as zeros and let the read succeed.
 *
 *   A null dereference, which cannot be healed that way because page zero can
 *   never be committed. These are all simple loads - mov esi,[ecx+0x34] - so
 *   decode the instruction, put zero in the destination, and step over it.
 *
 * Off unless D3D11SW_HEAL is set to a number, which is also the cap: after that
 * many the guard stands down and the next fault is a real crash, so a run that

 * an odd dimension. Packed atlases are routinely an odd number of pixels tall,
 * so most of the memory this was written to reclaim was being skipped.
 *
 * Colour is averaged in linear light and premultiplied by alpha first. Straight
 * alpha stores fully transparent pixels as transparent BLACK, so averaging the

 * a dark fringe once it is composited. Premultiplying makes the filter commute
 * with the "over" it will later take part in, which is the whole reason that
 * representation exists. Alpha itself is coverage and is neither gamma-encoded
 * nor premultiplied by anything, so it is averaged as-is.
 *
 * Bytes 0..2 are treated as colour and byte 3 as alpha, which holds for both
 * R8G8B8A8 and B8G8R8A8 - the same curve applies to all three colour channels,
 * so their order does not matter here.

 * slot 0x10 - Release - on each entry. Unity's list came back from the save,
 * our queries did not, and the first word of the block it called through was
 * whatever now occupies that memory. It faulted on the first present after every
 * restore, in three different heap configurations, because present is the first
 * thing that happens after any restore.
 *
 * Keeping the header keeps the vtable, so a stale Release lands on real code and
 * decrements a refcount nobody reads. The payload still goes back to the heap,

 * for OSFE was to stop reporting a one-entry display mode list and let Unity
 * build a real dropdown. Some games have no such menu at all. Rabbit and
 * Steel's graphics options have a DISPLAY mode toggle and nothing else, so in
 * fullscreen it takes the desktop size and every one of those pixels is shaded
 * here. Measured in that game: ~47 ms of raster per frame at 2560x1440 against
 * ~19.7 ms at 1600x900, so raster time tracks pixel count almost exactly.
 *
 * Capping costs nothing to display. swrast_present already ends in
 * StretchDIBits from the backbuffer size to the client rect, so a smaller
 * buffer is upscaled by GDI inside the blit that was happening anyway.
 *
 * The cap is reported truthfully through GetDesc, because a game sizes its own
 * render targets and viewports from the backbuffer and a lie there would break
 * drawing outright. That has one consequence, and it is the reason this is off
 * by default: a game that reads the mouse in window client pixels and tests it
 * against a UI laid out in backbuffer pixels will have its hit-testing offset

/* Whether a released object's PIXELS must be kept, not just its header.
 *
 * Retirement was built to stop a crash and it does, but it answers only half the
 * question. The game comes out of a restore holding a pointer to a texture it
 * released after the save; keeping the header means that pointer finds an object
 * rather than freed memory, and keeping the header ALONE means the object it
 * finds is empty. The draw path then drops the sprite, which is the missing
 * artwork after a reload - not a Unity fault, and not the render-path crash
 * either. It is this decision.
 *
 * A savestate is a claim that the program can go back to a moment. Everything
 * visible at that moment is part of the moment, so texture content released
 * afterwards is not garbage yet - it is state the snapshot still refers to. The
 * memory is real and worst case is roughly one scene's texture set, since a
 * quit-to-menu releases the lot; the cap keeps that bounded and says so out loud
 * rather than growing without limit. */
/* Whether the address space can still afford to retain anything.
 *
 * The megabyte budget above cannot know what else is going on. Rabi-Ribi was
 * already holding 1473 MB of VA at the moment of the save, so a 512 MB budget
 * aimed the retained set at 1985 MB - the 2 GB wall, near enough to touch. The
 * session bore that out: it ran on to 1901 MB with 19 MB as its largest free
 * block, which is not heading toward exhaustion, it is already there.
 *
 * So the real limit is not a number chosen in advance, it is how much room is
 * left. Retention stops while a floor of free space remains, which costs
 * sprites released late in a long session but keeps the process alive to draw
 * the rest. Sampled rather than measured per release: walking the whole address
 * space runs to hundreds of regions and Res_Release is on the hot path. */

 * the game's memory at the snapshot held no pointer to it, because it did not
 * exist yet, and a restore puts that memory back exactly as it was. So the
 * game comes out of the restore unable to name it, by construction.
 *
 * Retaining it therefore buys nothing and costs twice. It costs the payload,
 * which is most of the growth: a restore-heavy session releases mostly objects
 * made since the save, and they were all being kept. And it costs correctness,
 * because ledger_reap frees post-save payloads on restore while the retain list
 * goes on pointing at them - a later flush then frees the same address twice,
 * or worse, frees whatever has since been allocated over it.

	 * loop this replaces put it in every slot of the factory table, including
	 * the IDXGIFactory2 methods that take five and six arguments -
	 * CreateSwapChainForCoreWindow, RegisterOcclusionStatusWindow and the rest.
	 * On x86 stdcall the callee cleans the stack, so calling one of those would

	 * frame - a crash somewhere else entirely, with nothing pointing back here.
	 *
	 * kNiStub has an entry per argument count and kArity_IDXGIFactory2Vtbl
