/* Keeping DirectSound's play cursor honest across a restore.
 *
 * The game streams audio by asking where the hardware is playing, comparing
 * that against where it last wrote, and copying the difference. That works
 * because time only moves forward. A restore breaks the assumption: dsound and
 * the audio stack are excluded from the rewind and have to be - they talk to
 * the sound card, and the card keeps playing while the game is stopped - so
 * afterwards the hardware's cursor is in the present and the game's write
 * position is several seconds in the past. The subtraction comes out negative.
 *
 * As an unsigned byte count that is 4.29 billion, and the game hands it to a
 * block copy. Caught at rabiribi.exe+36913A with ecx = FFEAAD9C, and again at
 * +6E9F8 with -128819. The second one wrote decoded audio over the allocator's
 * structures before it reached unmapped memory and faulted: ntdll was later
 * found dereferencing FFD6FFE3, which is not a pointer but two quiet 16-bit
 * samples, -42 and -29.
 *
 * A fault handler cannot fix this. rep movs faults only when it reaches memory
 * that is not there, having faithfully copied everything up to that point, so
 * by the time we see the exception the damage is done and clamping the count
 * only spares the remainder. The copy has to not be issued.
 *
 * So the cursor has to agree with the game's state, which means owning it.
 *
 * There is no proxy DLL here and no wrapper objects. A COM vtable is shared by
 * every instance of an implementation, so creating one throwaway device of our
 * own is enough to learn the address of the table the game's device will also
 * use. Patch the handful of methods that matter, release the throwaway, and
 * every buffer the game creates afterwards comes through us - regardless of
 * whether it got there via DirectSoundCreate8, the older entry point, or
 * CoCreateInstance, because all three land on the same implementation. */

 * resume_all and lumping them together got both wrong. Doing the whole thing
 * after the threads restart means stopping, seeking and starting 700 buffers
 * while the game is already reading those same cursors - a race we caused.
 * Doing the whole thing before means calling Play into dsound with every thread
 * suspended, which risks waiting on a lock a suspended thread holds.
 *
 * Seeking has neither problem. The buffers are already stopped, because
 * dsh_quiet stopped them at the top of the restore, so there is no mixer to
 * race and no work for dsound to do beyond writing a field. And once it is
 * done, a buffer that is asked where it is - by a thread that has only just
 * resumed - answers with the position the game expects rather than one from
 * several seconds in its future. That is the whole point, and it has to be
 * true from the first instruction the game executes, not from whenever we get
