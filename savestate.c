/* Rewind for a process we do not own, driven from the graphics wrapper we
 * already inject.
 *
 * Windows has no checkpoint/restore. PssCaptureSnapshot captures a process but
 * cannot put one back, so the state is reconstructed by hand: suspend every
 * game thread, copy its writable memory and register state aside, and write
 * both back on demand.
 *
 * Two things make that tractable here rather than merely theoretical. The
 * renderer is software, so every render target, texture and piece of pipeline
 * state is ordinary process memory we already own - there is no driver-side
 * state to rewind, which is normally the blocker. And the scope is a
 * within-session rewind, so no handle, socket or file has to survive being
 * recreated; the kernel objects the game holds are never closed, and their
 * handle values are still valid when the old memory goes back.
 *
 * Three constraints shape everything below.
 *
 * Nothing this file owns may appear in the snapshot. The bookkeeping describes
 * the restore that is in progress, so if the restore writes over it the loop
 * destroys its own instructions as it runs. Every allocation here is therefore
 * registered in an exclusion list that the region walk consults, and no CRT
 * heap is touched between suspend and resume - a rewind of the heap under a
 * live malloc is the same bug wearing a different hat.
 *
 * The target is a 32-bit process holding well over a gigabyte. A snapshot
 * cannot be a flat buffer in that address space, so it lives in a
 * pagefile-backed section and is streamed through a small sliding view. The
 * section may exceed what the process could ever map at once; only the window
 * costs address space.
 *
 * Present runs on one of the game's own threads, so the code requesting a
 * rewind stands on a stack the rewind must overwrite. The work happens on a
 * private helper thread whose stack is excluded, and the requesting thread
 * parks in a user-mode spin - never a kernel wait, which cannot be reliably
 * resumed after SetThreadContext - at a fixed instruction, so the context
 * captured during a save is always valid to restore into. */

 * after a restore, ntdll!RtlpDynamicFunctionTable's Blink pointed at
 * 0000021780879470, which !heap -x reported as an LFH FREE block in the game's

 *     call  memcpy

 * is positive, and the min is signed. So a count of -3 skips the refill - it is
 * not zero, so the branch always takes - and then passes -3 to memcpy, where as
 * an unsigned length it is 4294967293. rep movs copied 92528 bytes over the

 * exception was never going to be enough: the damage is done by the time we are
 * called, and clamping ecx only spares the remainder.
 *

 * remaining as total - position and clamps it with cmovle to zero; +36370 takes
 * an unsigned min with cmova. Only the innermost layer compares signed.
 *
 * jne becomes jg. A positive count still skips the refill, which is the normal
 * path and is untouched; a negative one now falls through to the decoder, which
 * resets the buffer. Nothing else changes, and the count is self-healing once a

 *
 * TEBs are kernel-managed but user-visible. Rewinding one desynchronises the

 * to happen. Those threads keep their own stacks and are left running; the
 * game's actual state lives in globals and the heap, which are still rewound.
 *
 * Two classes of module image are left alone. System libraries hold loader and
 * runtime bookkeeping shared with the kernel, and rewinding a critical section
 * to "free" under a thread about to release it corrupts the lock for good.
 * Steam and its overlay run their own threads on their own schedule, so their
 * globals must not move either; splitting purely on the Windows directory
 * missed that and cost a process.
 *
 * Everything else that ships with the game is rewound, and MSVCR100 is the
 * reason the rule is not simply "executable only". It is the game's C runtime:
 * its data section holds the heap handle and pointers into the very heap being
 * restored, so excluding it would split the allocator's bookkeeping from the

 *
 * Windows Error Reporting named the mechanism outright: the silent deaths were

 * That is the heap validating its own doubly-linked free list and finding links
 * that do not point back. It is a fail-fast, which is why nothing was ever
 * logged - it bypasses vectored handlers and every exit path we hook, and kills
 * the process where it stands. RPCRT4 raised its own fail-fast in the same

 *
 * So the line is not drawn around libraries, it is drawn around allocators. The

 * all keep their lists in it, and rewinding those lists is what kills us. The C
 * runtime heaps are private to their runtime - MSVCR100's serves the game's
 * malloc and new, msvcrt's serves this wrapper - and those are the ones that
 * have to travel with the game.
 *

 * index all live there. Putting any of those back tells the loader a lie about
 * which DLLs exist, and it collects at the next DLL load rather than at the
 * restore - LdrpInitializeThread on a thread that started afterwards, or
 * RtlpLocateActivationContextSection resolving a redirect. Both of those killed
 * this game, several hundred frames after a restore that looked clean.
 *
 * They reach the game's side of the closure by accident. Thread stacks are
 * roots, and a stack that has ever been through LoadLibrary or GetModuleHandle
 * still has loader pointers in dead frames, so the walk above adopts them on an
 * exact base match like any other object. Excluding the TEB and the PEB does
 * not help: that protects the pointers while the structures they name sit in
 * the heap we write.
 *
 * Deny wins, because the two mistakes are not the same size. Refusing a block
 * the game owned costs some state and the next restore tries again. Putting
 * back a block the loader owned costs the process.
 *
 * This is deliberately a closure and not a list of structures. Walking
 * PEB->Ldr field by field means encoding a layout that changes between Windows
 * releases, and a pointer missed there - the DDAG node, the index tree - reads
 * as a fixed bug right up until the next crash. Following words that happen to
 * equal a block's base needs to know nothing about any of it, and picks up

/* What is actually inside the heap, block by block.
 *
 * Everything else in this file treats the game's heap as anonymous pages: a few
 * gigabytes of bytes to copy and put back. But a Windows heap describes itself.
 * Every block carries a header giving its size and whether it is in use, and we
 * have been walking straight past all of it while inferring ownership from
 * vtable votes and pointers out of segment headers - an inference that has now
 * been wrong in both directions, over-claiming in the fault reports and
 * under-claiming in the partition.
 *
 * HeapWalk reads those headers exactly. The reason this file has avoided it is
 * written down two hundred lines up: it takes the heap's lock, and the snapshot
 * runs with every thread suspended, one of which may be holding it. That
 * objection is entirely about save time. A census is not a save. Run with the
 * process healthy and its threads live, taking the lock is ordinary, and the
 * one measurement we could never make becomes free.
 *
 * A census is worth taking twice and comparing, which is what the fingerprints
 * are for. Addresses cannot be compared across runs - the bases are randomised
 * - but the randomisation is a base plus a fixed offset, and we hold the bases,
 * so it cancels rather than needing to be inferred around. Below the bases
 * there is real entropy: the low-fragmentation heap deliberately shuffles which
 * slot in a size class a block lands in. That shuffle moves blocks; it does not
 * invent or resize them. So two fingerprints get taken, and the pair is the
 * measurement:
 *
 *   shape - the exact multiset of (size, in use), combined commutatively so
 *           order cannot affect it. Immune to the LFH shuffle.
 *   seq   - the same values in walk order. Sensitive to placement.
 *
 * shape equal with seq differing says the same allocations happened and only
 * their placement moved. shape differing says the content itself is different,
 * and the histogram says in which size classes. */

 * heap's front end, a recycled thread stack, XInput's per-thread runtime data -
 * all the same sentence with a different subject. Each one cost a crash, a
 * dump, and an evening, because the only symptom is a fail-fast somewhere
 * unrelated, minutes later, once the holder finally touches what it kept.
 *
 * The relationship is visible before it does any harm, though. A thread we
 * classify as the operating system's keeps its per-thread runtime state in its
 * thread block and in the storage vector that hangs off it, and we know which
 * heaps we intend to rewind. If any of those pointers lands in one, that is the
 * next crash, named in advance and while the process is still healthy.
 *
 * The search deliberately does not know any structure layouts. Per-thread
 * runtime state is reached through a chain - the thread block points at a
 * storage vector or a fiber-local table, and the blocks that matter hang off
 * that - and the shape of those tables differs between Windows versions, so
 * walking them by offset would work on the machine it was written on and go
 * quietly blind elsewhere. Following any pointer the thread block holds into a
 * small private allocation, and searching that too, finds the same blocks
 * without naming a single field. XInput's per-thread data, which cost us a
 * night, sits exactly one hop out.
 *
 * This only reports. A pointer here is not proof of a fault - a system thread
 * may legitimately be holding something the game handed it - so where it was
 * found and which heap owns it go in the line, and the judgement stays with
 * whoever reads it. */

/* What a reachability pass would have to hold.
 *
 * The game's runtime heap turned out to be the process heap. Windows keeps its
 * own bookkeeping there - dynamic function tables for jitted code, critical
 * section records, RPC bindings, thread pool timers - so the game's objects and
 * the operating system's share one allocator, and no whole-heap policy can
 * separate them. Rewinding that heap gave FAST_FAIL_CORRUPT_LIST_ENTRY inside
 * ntdll and an access violation on a thread pool timer during RPC teardown;
 * leaving it behind stranded the game's own objects and faulted Unity on a
 * zeroed vtable. Both sides of that choice are wrong.
 *
 * The line has to fall per block, and the honest way to place it is to ask what
 * the present can still reach. The images we leave behind are the roots: a
 * pointer in one of them landing in a heap we rewind names a block that has to
 * stay, and so does anything that block points at, transitively - hold a list's
 * head and rewind its second node and the links disagree just the same.
 *
 * This only measures. Acting on it needs holes inside a saved region, which the
 * exclusion list cannot express: region_excluded is all or nothing, so a single
 * held unit would drop the segment around it, and the list caps at SS_MAX_EXCL.
 * How large the closure is decides whether that is worth building, so it gets
 * counted before anything is held. */

/* The unit the closure is measured and held in.
 *
 * A page was the wrong unit and it is what made the first measurement useless:
 * holding one carries the five hundred words that merely surround the pointer
 * that justified holding it, each of which is then followed as if it mattered,
 * so the closure ran past 64 MB and was still growing. A heap block is the unit
 * the exclusion actually wants, but its bounds cannot be had from here, because
 * HeapWalk takes the heap's lock and this runs with every thread suspended, one
 * of which may be holding it.
 *
 * A granule sized like a list node approximates a block without asking the heap
 * anything. At 64 bytes a held unit carries eight words rather than five
 * hundred, which is where the spurious edges were coming from. It also covers
 * the part of a node that matters: a LIST_ENTRY keeps its forward and backward
 * links at offset zero, so the granule holding a node's start holds the links
 * whose disagreement is what ntdll fails on, even where the node is longer than
 * the granule. */

 * structure, arrived at from the opposite direction.
 *
 * The stride was left as a TODO in that file, so it is derived here instead.
 * Two artbook timers in the same table are declared at +0x1310 and +0xB2FC,
 * being the same field on two different entities; the gap between them is
 * 0x9FEC, which 0x6F4 divides exactly 23 times. The check that settles it is
 * independent: the first allocation this game ever makes is 176,220 bytes, and

 * block this engine has been tracking at heap offset +0x7F4B8 since the
 * beginning is the entity table itself.
 *
 * Worth having because searching for coordinates finds coordinate-shaped bytes.
 * An earlier hunt for Ribbon turned up four candidates, three of them in a
 * DxLib arena that cannot hold entities at all. Walking the array cannot return
 * a false positive: slot 3 is slot 3.

/* Is any thread running ntdll code that is not a parked system call?
 *
 * Heap locks do not answer this. blk_lock_all holds every heap's lock while the
 * block map is walked, which excludes the classic allocator paths - but the low
 * fragmentation heap deliberately does not take that lock. Its fast path runs on
 * interlocked SLists precisely so that it never has to, so HeapLock succeeds
 * while a thread is halfway through an LFH allocation, and the snapshot is taken
 * anyway.
 *
 * That is the fault at 0D2AF674: thread 4488 was suspended inside the LFH path
 * with ntdll+90CF5 and ntdll+43ACF beneath it. Its stack was held in the present
 * because it is a system thread we exclude, and while it stood still we wrote 92
 * MB of block contents underneath it. On resume its locals still pointed where
 * they had pointed, but the bytes there had been replaced with bytes from the
 * past, so the target it computed was not a function and it jumped into its own
 * stack - the instruction pointer landed 348 bytes above the stack pointer, in
 * the same allocation.
 *
 * Nothing can be restored differently to fix that. Both halves of the
 * inconsistency are legitimate: the stack must stay in the present because it
 * has kernel-side state we cannot rewind, and the heap must go back because that
 * is the whole point. As with the JIT, the only repair is not to take the
 * picture at that moment.
 *
 * The test has to be coarse, because the functions involved are internal and
 * naming them means hard-coding offsets into whichever ntdll this machine
 * shipped. But the whole module is too coarse the other way: threads park in
 * ntdll for their entire lives waiting on handles, and a loop that waits for
 * those would never settle. So the parked ones are subtracted by address. Every
 * Nt* system call stub lives in one contiguous block, so a few exported ones
 * give its bounds, and a thread sitting in any wait is inside it. A thread in
 * ntdll but outside it is running real code, which for our purposes is close
 * enough to "might be in the allocator" - the false positives are things like
 * critical section entry, which are over in microseconds and cost us one more

 * entropy per byte and not one `push ebp; mov ebp,esp` in the whole section,
 * where a real image that size would have thousands. .rdata and .data are

 *
 * We are on the other side of that. The stub decrypts into memory and we are in
 * the memory, so the only thing standing between us and a readable disassembly
 * is writing the bytes down.
 *
 * Three fixups make the result loadable rather than merely present. The section
 * headers get PointerToRawData set to VirtualAddress, because on disk a section
 * is packed to FileAlignment and in memory it is spread to SectionAlignment, and
 * a loader told otherwise reads every section from the wrong place. FileAlignment
 * is raised to match SectionAlignment so that remains self-consistent. And
 * ImageBase is rewritten to wherever ASLR actually put us, so that the absolute
 * addresses baked into the code - which is all of them, this being a 32-bit image
 * whose relocations were already applied - agree with where the disassembler
 * thinks it is looking.
 *
 * The sidecar exists because a dumped IAT holds resolved addresses rather than
 * names, so every call through it disassembles as an indirect jump to a bare
 * number. The import table usually survives and is walked when it does; the
 * module list is written unconditionally, because it is what lets any raw

 * recomputes those from the things they describe. Putting one back is worse
 * than leaving it alone, because the value we paint in disagrees with the state
 * it claims to summarise and the game acts on the summary. DxLib's SubHandle
 * zeroing a pool sentinel is this exactly: the shelf reads empty, so the game
 * makes more stock on top of the stock that is already there.
 *
 * The two kinds are separable by observation rather than by analysis, which
 * matters because analysis has now failed at it three times - reachability, the
 * ntdll veto and content sniffing are all attempts to decide ownership of a
 * word by looking at it. Three values name a word instead: what it held before
 * the restore, what we wrote, and what it holds a few hundred ms later. A word
 * that has gone back to its pre-restore value in spite of what we wrote was
 * recomputed by the game from state it trusts more than ours. That is derived,
 * and the next restore leaves it in the present.
 *
 * This buys a pre-image, so it is budgeted. A 32-bit process already carrying
 * 1.5 GB cannot hold a second copy of 279 MB, and it does not need to: the
 * regions worth watching are the ones that reverted last time, so those are
 * captured first and the rest fill whatever budget is left.
 *
 * The mask only ever grows within a session. A word held back keeps its live
 * value, so it trivially still looks reverted on the next check and stays in
 * the set - self-sustaining by design, since a shelf does not stop being a

 * keystroke, but it cannot be written blind, for two reasons found the hard way.
 *
 * The addresses are return addresses. +33DCE is the instruction after a call,

 * section, so the shipped file is Steam-DRM encrypted and decrypted at load:
 * the nine bytes decoder_patch_once finds in memory every session appear
 * nowhere in the six megabytes on disk, and the bytes at the faulting address
 * on disk are not the instruction cdb disassembled there. Only the running
 * process knows what this code is.
 *
 * So the probe reads the decrypted image and reports what is actually at each
 * call site. A 32-bit direct call is E8 rel32, so where the byte five back is
 * E8 the callee entry is exact arithmetic rather than a prologue guess. It
 * writes nothing: the point is to find out whether a forced call is possible
 * and where it would have to enter, before anything is patched. Printing the
 * entry RVAs each session also answers the cheaper half of the question on its

 *
 * Every measurement of this game so far has cost a manual session: launch, play
 * somewhere interesting, press F5, press shift-F5, read one number, and the
 * process is usually dead by then so that is the whole run. One point per
 * session cannot show a shape, and the shape is the question. The last run
 * survived eight frames where earlier ones survived none, and there is no way
 * to tell from a single sample whether that means anything.
 *
 * So arm once and let it run trials by itself. Each trial saves, lets the game
 * run on for a dwell, restores, and counts the frames the game manages before
 * something kills it. The dwell doubles every rung. That ladder is the
 * experiment: if survival falls as the dwell grows, the damage is a function of
 * how far the present has moved on since the snapshot, and divergence is the
 * variable. If survival is flat, it is not, and the distance we have been
 * assuming matters does not.
 *
 * It does not stop at the first bad trial, and it is not trying to succeed.
 * Reaching a rung that kills the game reliably is the useful outcome, because
 * a repeatable death at a known dwell is something a debugger can be pointed
 * at, and a whole session of them costs one arming keystroke. */
