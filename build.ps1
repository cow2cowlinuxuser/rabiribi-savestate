# What it changes is only what an environment variable cannot: code generation.
# -march=haswell lets the whole translation unit use AVX2 rather than just the
# hand-written kernels that carry a target attribute, which mainly helps the
# scalar fallback and the per-pixel blend paths the vector kernel declines.
#
# That also makes the binary refuse to start on anything older than Haswell,
# with an illegal instruction rather than a clean message. That is the entire
# reason it is a separate file: the stock DLL stays runnable everywhere.
#
# -ffp-contract=off is not optional here. Once FMA is available the compiler may
# contract the scalar span arithmetic into a single rounding while the vector
# kernel keeps two, and the two paths stop agreeing bit for bit. Both seam
# audits flag that divergence as dormant precisely because the stock build has
# no FMA to contract into; -march=haswell would wake it up.
