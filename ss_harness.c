/* A test harness for the savestate engine.
 *
 * Why this exists. Against the game, the only oracle is "did it die", and
 * reaching a verdict costs a Steam launch, a debugger attach, several minutes of
 * play, and sometimes the evidence itself. Here we can assert on structures
 * immediately after every restore and get a verdict in milliseconds.
 *
 * What it drives is the real engine: savestate.c, unmodified, through the same
 * savestate_save and savestate_load the wrapper calls. A harness that
 * reimplemented any of it would prove nothing.
 *
 * Two scenarios, chosen by the third argument.
 *
 * synth - a hand-built structure shaped like _MonoJitInfoTable, filled by
 * threads that can be caught mid-loop. This modelled the crash of 2026-08-30
 * (a 380-entry chunk array with a hole at index 281) and falsified the simple
 * form of that theory: 120 cycles, 109 of them catching a fill in flight, zero
 * bad restores. Catching a writer mid-update is survivable, because the restore
 * rewinds the writer too and it does the work again.
 *
 * mono - the real mono-2.0-bdwgc.dll out of the game's own folder, initialised
 * as a runtime and made to JIT thousands of real mscorlib methods while
 * snapshots are taken underneath it. This is the scenario the synth one cannot
 * be: real jit-info tables, real chunk splits, real growable unwind tables
 * registered with ntdll, and the real GC running its own threads on its own
 * schedule. What it still does not exercise is Unity's render thread and the
 * D3D11 object graph, so OSFE stays the acceptance test.
 *
 * The oracle in mono mode is mono_jit_info_table_find. Every compile is
 * recorded as (method, code) in memory the snapshot excludes, and after each
 * restore every method compiled before the save must still be findable by its
 * code address and must still name the same method. That call walks the exact
 * structure that crashed. */

/* Heap identity across a restore.
 *
 * On 2026-09-09 the game froze with a call to address zero inside
 * ntdll!RtlAbPostRelease, reached from RtlLeaveCriticalSection releasing a heap
 * lock, reached from RtlpLocalInfoAllocFromCache - the low fragmentation heap's
 * front end. The heap in question was 0d6e0000, and cdb, having walked the heap
 * regions, did not classify it as a heap at all: "Usage: <unknown>". A thread
 * was allocating from a heap Windows no longer believed existed.
 *
 * The theory that fits is heap identity rather than block contents. A heap
 * created after the snapshot is not in it; the restore rewinds the process heap
 * list to a state that predates the heap, so ntdll forgets it, while the handle
 * and the memory both survive in the hands of whatever is still using them. If
 * that is right it should reproduce here with no game, no Steam and no audio -
 * and if it does not reproduce, the theory is wrong and a week of chasing the
 * low fragmentation heap gets called off.
 *
 * Every check below is one Windows can answer about itself. The point is not to
 * assert that our blocks came back; it is to ask ntdll whether it still knows
 * what a heap is, which is the question the crash raised. */
