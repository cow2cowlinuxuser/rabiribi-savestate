/* A software XAudio2.
 *
 * The DirectSound route is closed and we know why. Steam has
 * C:\WINDOWS\System32\dsound.dll in the process before our DLL attaches, so a
 * same-folder stub is never asked for the name; and patching
 * DirectSoundCreate8 in the loaded module changed nothing either, because a
 * completed save and load afterwards produced no ds_sw report at all, which
 * means DxLib never called the export. CLSID_DirectSound is in the executable,
 * and a CoCreateInstance goes through the registry to an absolute path and
 * touches neither the name nor the export. Both of our levers miss it by
 * construction.
 *
 * xaudio2_9.dll has neither problem. Steam does not preload it, so the game
 * folder wins the search - measured, not assumed: the load probe attached as
 * ...\Rabi-Ribi\xaudio2_9.DLL and DxLib called straight into it with
 * XAudio2Create(flags=0, processor=0xFFFFFFFF).
 *
 * It is also the easier thing to stand in for, and for a reason that goes to
 * the heart of the bug. DirectSound is a ring with a hardware play cursor, and
 * every failure this project has chased came from that cursor and the game's
 * write position being two clocks that rewind differently. XAudio2 pushes:
 * the game hands us whole buffers and asks how many samples have played. There
 * is no ring to wrap, no write cursor to keep ahead of a play cursor, and no
 * unsigned subtraction that can come out negative. The state is a queue we own
 * and a sample count we advance.
 *
 * There is no audio thread here, deliberately. Real XAudio2 fires
 * OnBufferEnd from its own mixer thread, which is exactly the kind of second
 * party we are removing - something that runs while every game thread is
 * suspended and holds pointers into memory we are about to rewind. Instead the
 * clock advances lazily, inside whatever call the game itself makes, so every
 * callback runs on the game's thread. Nothing touches audio state except the
 * game, which is the process shape -nosound has.
 *
 * Phase one is silent. Nothing is mixed and nothing reaches the speakers; the
 * PCM the game submits is never even read. The question this answers is
 * whether the game survives a restore with its audio entirely inside memory we
 * own, and putting a mixer thread in before that is answered would reintroduce
 * the writer we are trying to prove is gone.
 *
 * Execute-at-0 after CreateMasteringVoice is not a missing vtable slot here.
 * DxLib delay-loads X3DAudioInitialize from the same xaudio2_9.dll that
 * answered XAudio2Create; those extra names are exported from xa2_fwd.c. */
