 * driver reproduces that reliably - the modifier arrives, the key arrives, and
 * the two are not overlapping by the time anything reads them. A load key of
 * its own needs no overlap, so D3D9SW_LOAD_VK is what makes an unattended run
 * able to restore at all. Shift+save remains the default, so nothing changes
